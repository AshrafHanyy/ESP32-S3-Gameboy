# ESP32-Gameboy

This is the repository for the files of my DIY ESP32-Gameboy Project. 

You can watch the video for the project here:

The firmware of the handheld can be found on:
https://github.com/ducalex/retro-go
https://github.com/ducalex/odroid-go-multi-firmware

As the project itself is pin-compatible with the Odroid Go, you can also use the many available alternative firmwares with it.

Happy Building!
